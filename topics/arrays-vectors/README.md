## Arrays and Vectors

A collection of programs demonstrating array-based computation and test-driven development.

Concepts covered:
- Arrays and array traversal
- Aggregation operations (sum, min, max)
- Prime checking and counting
- Test-driven development patterns
- Separation of interface (.h) and implementation (.cpp)

Example compile & run:
g++ -std=c++17 *.cpp -o arrays_demo
./arrays_demo
